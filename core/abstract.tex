\section*{Abstract}
At Schneider Electric, engineers engaged in the development of AI algorithms require high-quality data samples. However, obtaining these data from the field presents challenges due to the limited connectivity of field products to the system. To address this challenge, this project proposes designing a ready-to-run acquisition system for monitoring electrical parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, and noise. This system will demonstrate high accuracy while operating efficiently on battery power, and it will establish a connection to the cloud using narrowband IoT technology, such as LTE-M. Subsequently, the acquired data will undergo analysis using local MATLAB and Simulink tools. Following the data analysis, our developed Simulink embedded algorithms will generate C code, which will then be seamlessly integrated into the firmware. This code will facilitate RMS measurements and anomaly detection for various loads.\par
